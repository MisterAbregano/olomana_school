    <div class="bio">
      <p><strong>Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi</strong>, Mr. R Abregano — affectionately known as <em>“Mr. A”</em> — is a lifelong learner, sports fan, and committed <strong>Hawaiian cultural practitioner</strong>. Though he once found his greatest peace in the ocean, a gradual loss of vision shifted his course. In response, he embraced new passions: <strong>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</strong>, <strong>video games</strong>, and a deeper connection to his <strong>Hawaiian cultural foundations</strong>.</p>

      <p>Mr. A dances hula alongside his <strong>awesome and talented wife, Mrs. Alexis</strong> — also known lovingly as <strong>Mrs. A 🌺</strong>. <strong>They both are in preparations for an exciting hula competition in Hilo, Hawaiʻi.</strong> His favorite pastime is singing and playing traditional Hawaiian music.</p>

      <p>He is a lifelong fan of <strong>Detroit, Michigan — 313 "Motor City"</strong> — a place known for its <strong>blue-collar GRIT and the pursuit of the American dream: fast cars, Motown music, Megatron, and good ol’ Barry</strong>. When he says “Detroit vs. The World,” it’s about resilience: backing your home no matter the odds. From the Lions to the Pistons, Red Wings, and Tigers, Mr. A supports them all.</p>

      <p>At <strong>Olomana School</strong>, Mr. A brings that same GRIT, creativity, and kuleana to uplift haumāna through culture, humor, and high expectations.</p>

        “Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to build on my own dreams. I look forward to meeting each of you and offering encouragement throughout your time at Olomana. My wife and I are currently preparing for an exciting hula competition in Hilo, Hawaiʻi.”<br><br>
        <strong>E aloha pū,</strong><br>
        <em>Mr. R Abregano</em>
