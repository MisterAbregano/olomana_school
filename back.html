        <h3>Mr. R Abregano</h3>
        <p><strong>Mr. R Abregano</strong> is a Native Hawaiian cultural educator and practitioner rooted in the traditional practices of 
        <strong>hele lālau</strong> <em>(subsistence hunting)</em>, 
        <strong>lawaiʻa</strong> <em>(traditional fishing)</em>, 
        <strong>mele</strong> <em>(Hawaiian chant and song)</em>, and 
        <strong>hula protocol</strong> <em>(ceremonial practices of dance and ritual)</em>.</p>
        <p>Raised in the values of <strong>aloha ʻāina</strong> <em>(love for the land)</em> and 
        <strong>kuleana</strong> <em>(responsibility)</em>, he brings 
        <strong>ʻike kupuna</strong> <em>(ancestral knowledge)</em> into modern educational spaces with intention and heart.</p>
        <p>He is passionate about learning from and with his <strong>haumāna</strong> <em>(students)</em>, seeking to understand their lived experiences 
        so he can offer grounded, alternative perspectives. Through his cultural upbringing, he has been encouraged to cultivate 
        <strong>substance within our keiki</strong> <em>(children)</em>—not only in what they learn, but in who they become.</p>
        <p>His approach honors identity, purpose, and the deep connections between people and place.</p>
