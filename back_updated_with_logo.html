      <h1>Mr. R Abregano</h1>
      <p>Born in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, "Mr. A" loved the ocean until slowly losing his vision. He adapted and became a video game enthusiast, sports fan, and martial arts practitioner. He currently dances hula with his awesome and talented wife, Mrs. Alexis (also known lovingly as Aunty Sweets 💃🏽) for Hālau ʻO Maluakiʻiwailehua under Kumu Kuana Torres Kahele. His all-time favorite thing to do is sing and play Hawaiian music.</p>
      <p><em>It’s about resilience: believing in your cause and living every moment towards success. No matter what the odds are; deny the doubters. There is zero tolerance for bullying in my classroom. Please respect each others space and time.</em></p>
      <p>Mr. Abregano was employed as an Electrician by IBEW 1186. Because of his time in Michigan, he is a lifelong sports fan of the 313 "Detroit Motor City" — a place known for its Blue-Collar GRIT and the pursuit of the all American dream: fast cars, Motown music, MegaTron, and good ol’ Barry. When he says out loud, “Detroit vs. The World,”! That's all about resilience, supporting your squad; no matter the odds. It all begins with the Lions, then the Pistons, the Red Wings, and D's Tigers! Mr. A spends a lot of weekends supporting his fam while experiencing new vibes with friends.</p>
      <p><strong>E Aloha pū,</strong></p>
